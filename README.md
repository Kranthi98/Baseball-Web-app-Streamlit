# Baseball-Web-app-Streamlit


Hi All,

Basically the code has been written for a simple web app usign Streamlit, in order to gain indept insights and stats of Baseball players.
The code uses widely known python library "Pybaseball".Additionaly to run the code there is one simple excel csv file that needs to be supplied.
Its just a file that consists of the abbreviations and full forms of pitch types.

As of now(11/09/2022) the work is still in progress. Will update it here once iam done.

Thanks.
