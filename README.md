# Baseball-Web-app-Streamlit


Hi All,

Basically the code has been written for a simple web app usign Streamlit, in order to gain indept insights and stats of Baseball players.
The code uses widely known python library "Pybaseball".Additionaly to run the code there is one simple excel csv file that needs to be supplied.
Its just a file that consists of the abbreviations and full forms of pitch types.

## Execution

1. Make sure you install virtualenv by using the line

    ```pip install virtualenv```
    

2. Change the working directory to the directory you are currently working by using **cd >path<** command
3. Open Command prompt and create a virtual environment in your desktop by using

    ```python -m virtualenv >Environment Name<```
  
4. install the packages with the versions mentioned in the requirements.txt file by using 

    ```pip install -r >path to requirements.txt<```

5.Hopefully you will be able to run the codes in the virtual environment you have created.
